# Banking-Customer-Support-Portal

Report
Banking Support Portal Requirements:

	Project Overview
The Banking Customer Support Portal aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for customers to post their complaints and queries. The system will intelligently route these complaints to the appropriate teams for resolution. It will also incorporate features like real-time auto-suggestions, email communication, and chat bot integration to streamline customer support operations.

	Technology Stack
-	Backend Development:
-	Java
-	Spring Boot (for microservices)
-	
-	Frontend Development:
-	React.js
-	JavaScript
-	HTML & CSS
-	
-	Database Management:
-	MySQL/Oracle
-	
-	Containerization and Deployment:
-	Docker
-	Kubernetes
-	Version Control and CI/CD:
-	Git (Gitlab for version control)
-	Jenkins for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

	 Functionalities:
1. Customer-Side Functionalities:
	Complaint Posting
-	Customers can submit their complaints via the portal.

	Auto Suggestion of FAQs
-	Real-time suggestions will be provided based on the nature of the complaint.

	Dashboard for Tracking
-	Customers can view and track the status of their complaints.

	Email Notifications
-	Automated emails will be sent to customers upon complaint submission and resolution.

	Chat Bot Integration:
-	The chat bot will handle repetitive queries and provide links to relevant FAQ documents.
	Repetitive Queries:
•	Repetitive queries are common issues or requests that customers often raise, such as unlocking a user account, updating contact information (like mobile number or address), or resetting a PIN.

	Chat Bot Workflow:
•	When a customer posts a query related to one of these repetitive tasks, the Chat Bot will intercept the message.
•	It will analyze the query to determine the nature of the request (e.g., unlock, update, reset).
•	The Chat Bot will then use the REST API to communicate with the backend of the system to perform the necessary action.

	Providing FAQ Links:
•	In addition to directly resolving queries, the Chat Bot can also suggest relevant FAQ document links.


	Backend Functionalities:
	Ticket Routing
-	Complaints will be automatically assigned to the appropriate teams based on category.

	Ticket Handling
-	Support teams can view and update the status and comments on query tickets.

	Dashboard for Assignments
-	Support teams can view and manage their assigned tickets.

	 MIS/Reporting Module
	Data Retrieval
-	This module will allow retrieval of data from the system for reporting purposes.

	Downloadable Reports
-	Reports will be available for download in CSV, Excel, and PDF formats.

	 Architectural Considerations:
   - Microservice Architecture:
   - The application will be built as a collection of loosely coupled microservices.
   - Each microservice will handle a specific functionality (e.g., Complaints, Routing, Chat Bot, etc.).
